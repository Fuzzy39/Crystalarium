Crystalarium is a software toy for experimenting with digital and ternary logic built in monogame. With it you can experiment with logic gates, latches, and even build a calculator or full fleged CPU.

## Controls
blah blah

## Rulesets
Crystalarium supports multiple different simulation systems, called rulesets, which define what placable objects (agents) exist and how they interact. As of the current version, three rulesets are available.
For information on how the included rulesets work, refer to [LINK]

## Current State
Crystalarium is currently in what I'd call an alpha state. The core simulation is present, but some capabilities are missing, only a few hardcoded rulesets are available, and users cannot yet make their own ruleset. The user interface is very minimal and there aren't many quality of life features. I make no promise that I'll continue developing Crystalarium, but I think at some point I'd like to.
